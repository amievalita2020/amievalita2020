Unfortunately nowadays more and more episodes of harassments against women arose and misogynistic comments can be found in social media, where misogynists hide themselves behind the security of the anonymity. Therefore, **it is very important to identify misogyny in social media**. Recent investigations studied how the misogyny phenomenon takes place, for example as unjustified slurring or as stereotyping of the role/body of a woman (i.e. the hashtag #getbacktokitchen), as described in the book by Poland[[1]](#ref1). 

A preliminary research work was conducted by Hewitt et al. [[2]](#ref2) as first attempt of manually classification of misogynous tweets. 
Automatic misogyny identification in Social Media has been firstly investigated by Anzovino et al. [[3]](#ref3). The same shared task has been organized in occasion of [IberEval-2018](https://sites.google.com/view/ibereval-2018) and [Evalita 2018](http://www.evalita.it/2018).
