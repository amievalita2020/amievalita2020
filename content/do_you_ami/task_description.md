The AMI shared task proposes the automatic identification of misogynous content in Italian language in Twitter. More specifically, it is organized according to two main subtasks:

- **Subtask A - Misogyny \& Aggressive Behaviour Identification**: 
a system must recognize if a text is misogynous or not, and in case of misogyny, if it expresses an aggressive attitude. 

- **Subtask B - Unbiased Misogyny Identification**: a system must discriminate misogynistic contents from the non-misogynistic ones, while guaranteeing the fairness of the model (in terms of unintended bias) on a synthetic dataset.
