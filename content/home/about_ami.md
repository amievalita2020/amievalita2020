Welcome to the web page of AMI, the second shared task on **Automatic Misogyny Identification** at 7th evaluation campaign [EVALITA 2020](http://www.evalita.it/2020).

Given the huge amount of user-generated contents on the Web, and in particular on social media, the problem of detecting, and therefore possibly limit the diffusion of hate speech against women, is rapidly becoming fundamental especially for the societal impact of the phenomenon. The AMI shared task is aimed at **automatically identifying misogynous content in Twitter in Italian language**.
