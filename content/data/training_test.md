The datasets and their specific annotations are relevant with respect to the task. In particular:
- **Subtask A**: we will consider only the **raw dataset** and the annotations for the fields “misogynous” and "aggressiveness". 

- **Subtask B**: we will consider the **raw dataset** and the **synthetic dataset** only considering the annotations for the field “misogynous”. 

The training and the testing set will be made available through the AMI Google Group [amievalita2020](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/amievalita2020).
