The data that will be provided to the participants for the shared task comprises a *raw dataset* and a *synthetic dataset* for measuring bias.

- The **raw dataset** is a balanced dataset of tweets manually labelled according to two levels:
    - *Misogynous*: defines if the tweet is misogynous or not misogynous; it takes values as $1$ if the tweet is misogynous, $0$ if the tweet is not misogynous.
	- *Aggressiveness*: denotes the subject of the misogynistic tweet; it takes value as:
		- $1$: denotes an aggressive misogynous tweet;
		- $2$: denotes a non-aggressive misogynous tweet;
		- $0$: if the tweet is not misogynous.
